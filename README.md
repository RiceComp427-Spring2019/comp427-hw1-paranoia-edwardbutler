## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - I am assuming that the fans are positioned around the field, and that the security is incentivized to create a holistically great fan experience 
  (not only a safe one).
- Assets:
    - the comfort of those in attendence
    - the comfort of those on the field
    - the security of those in attendence
    - the security of those on the field
    - fan entertainment
    - the integrity of the sport (unbiasedness - the fairness of the game's outcome)
    - the long-term profitability of the stadium
- Threats:
    - Rowdy fans, who may engage in violent or dangerous behavior among each other or enter the field, putting those on the field at risk.
    - Fire, gas leaks, or natural disaster, which all pose safety risk
    - Power outage
    - Poor attendence, which will hinder ticket sales 
- Countermeasures:
    - Require that everyone who enters the stadium goes through a security protocol
        - This security...
    - Have stringent checks for alcohol, ensuring that everyone who purchases it is identified
    - Position reasonable security alongside the stands to minimize the likelihood (and time) that errant passengers enter the field
    - Ensuring that an ambulance is on-site and capable of being utilized swiftly 
    - Installing a back-up generator to insure against power outages, which disrupt the flow of the game
    - Installing smoke and gas detectors to alert security of potential danger

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Grading}
- Assumptions:
    - I am assuming that the class in question is a college English class in the United States and that the homework assignments are essays, which are turned in physically (i.e. via a paper handout) to the professor's mailbox. 
- Assets:
    - The character of the students
    - The reputation of the school
    - The integrity of the class
    - The grades of students who did honest work
    - The time of the professor and staff
- Threats:
    - Students directly copying the work of other students
    - Students directly plagiarizing the work found online
    - Students failing to cite the work of others online
    - Students hiring someone to do the work for them
    - Students turning in homework after the due date
    - Students making up a fake story to get out of doing the work
    - Excessive paranoia — systematically making false accusations of cheating
- Countermeasures:
    - Ensuring that students are aware of how to cite documents found from a multitude of sources

## Problem 3

- Assumptions:

  - explanatory_paragraph ...
